# Case-Design-Generator

Programmed Phone Cases design generator for my E-Commerce business to automate the cases design process. The business focused on selling phone cases with unique travel design. The design has a name of city, country and entails of the city. The main challenge was the large number of cities and the time that could take to design them in traditional method like using photoshop.
To overcome this challenge programmed an app using Java Proccessing3 that could take a list of cities and produce a design with the information provided with a unique colour at rate of a second per city per design.
